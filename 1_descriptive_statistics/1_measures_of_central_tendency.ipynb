    "When we talk about statistics, the most natural starting point for the journey is the arithmetic mean. As every simple concept, it is very powerfull and it is something that - trascending the statistics - we, as social animals, have to deal with daily. Don't we always have in mind an \"average something\" against which all the rest is compared? But aside from this digression, from a statistical perspective the mean is the most natural and straight forward way to describe a complex phenomenom. Imagine you have to answer the question: in the foru largest European countries, are women or men the more frequent investor in adult education? Let's see how to answer this question using data from the OECD."
